title: "First day at Robotics Research Center (RRC)"
---

This was basically Introducotry Class for students Joining RRC this summers, We we showcased all the Projects currently being undertaken at Robotics Research Center,<br>

Then followed by that we got started with the basics of liner algebra, 
- We were formally introduced by the terms and much more astanderd ways to deal with vecotrs and Matrices, 
- Usually x is used to represent column matrix and x<sup>T</sup> to represent row Matrics.
- Some Basic Operations
	- Vector addition
	- Scalar Multiplication
	- Element wise Operation.
	- Dot Product.
	- Cross Product.

- Norm is a function that takes a vector and returns a non-negetive number. It satisfies the following four Properties:

- There are many types of norm :

- Inner Product, Inner producct is a fucntions that takes two vector space and return a real number, the function need to satisfy five proterties:
	- Positivity : <x,x> >= 0
	- Definteness
	- Additivity
	- Homogenoity
	- Symmetry

- With every inner prodcut a norm is induced, 
	- norm(x) = sqrt(innerproduct(x,x))
