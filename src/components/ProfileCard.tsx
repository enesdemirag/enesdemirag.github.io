          Hey! I'm Enes. I'm someone who loves exploring and trying new things.
          <br /><br />
          I studied Engineering at Istanbul Technical University and currently work as an Software Engineer at Chooch, where I get to combine my love for AI and technology with problem-solving.
          <br /><br />
          I'm really into AI and technology. I love discussing new technologies and what the future might look like. I'm also talking about finance and investing. It's exciting to learn how things work and share ideas. I also enjoy playing video games. It's my favorite way to relax and have fun.
          Traveling is a big passion of mine. I enjoy visiting new places and experiencing different cultures. I also bring my drone along to capture amazing views from the sky.
